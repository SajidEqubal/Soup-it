    <string name="demoTxt">This is my advice on improving the UX of your designs WITHOUT hours of user research sessions, paper prototyping playtime, or any other trendy UX buzzwords.

(Seriously, search ‚Äúdesign thinking‚Äù. 0 results. Nailed it!)

Who‚Äôs this article for? I‚Äôm looking at you:

Developers. You created your own app, but every time someone downloads it, they struggle to use it. And you know if they‚Äôre telling you this, then it‚Äôs really bad.
Graphic designers. Looking to make the transition into digital, but trying to learn UX by reading articles online is‚Ä¶ a very painful way to die üò¨
PMs. Your job is already like 25% UX designer. Would be nice to level up those skills.
And the hustlers. Anyone working on digital side projects nights/weekends. This one‚Äôs for you too üçª
If you‚Äôre already a UX designer, I don‚Äôt expect this article to go over super well with you. I‚Äôm basically skipping over entire chunks of our field in favor of focusing entirely on the single most lacking skill in aspiring UX designers (or UX-adjacent folks who find themselves designing screens).

I call it ‚Äúspeaking interface‚Äù.

When I started as a professional UX designer, I was shocked how many times my clients would hand me the initial wireframes (or the living, breathing, in-browser MVP) and there‚Äôd be completely obvious UX mistakes all over them. I‚Äôm not talking about things you need hours of research and A/B testing to discover. I‚Äôm talking, like, dead simple mistakes.</string>
